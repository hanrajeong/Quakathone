Note: The refurbished code references an opensource template provided by GitHub due to complex dependencies for the project to be run through WatchOS.

- Motivation
  - Inspired by companion animals (pets) that can easily communicate with us
- What it does
  - The programmed duck interacts with the user
- How we built it
  - Using Swift on Xcode
- Challenges faced
  - Learning Swift for the first time and using its application
- Proud accomplishment
  - We successfully managed to compile our cyber-pet
- Lesson learned
  - Multiple source codes are required even for a simple application
- What's next for WOORI ORI
  - Add more stage such as evolving from an egg to an adult duck
  - Add more functions for more interactions and flexibilities with the user
  - Develop an iOS application for iPhone to connect to the Apple watch.
