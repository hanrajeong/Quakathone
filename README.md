* The template of the code is from the opensource, Github, I used it because doing the setting for the game in WatchOS is really complicated, requires a lot of libraries to install, so using the already set template helped me reducing time consumption on downloading all of those things. However, I converted every parts of the code into our own code.

- Inspiration

Inspired by a personal pet that can easily communicate with us

- What it does

It interacts with me

- How we built it

Using Swift on Xcode

- Challenges we ran into

Learning Swift for the first time and using its application

- Accomplishments that we're proud of

We successfully managed to compile our pet

- What we learned

Multiple source codes are required even for a simple application

- What's next for ORI DUCK

Add more stage : from egg to the adult duck
Add more function : Let it be more interactive with the user
Develop an ios application for iPhone, let it be connected to the Apple watch.
